## 💡 What is Drakon AI?

Drakon AI is a modular and completely offline AI engine, built to serve as the **core intelligence layer** for the Drakon MVP suite — a set of minimal, high-impact tools for B2B problem-solving.

This engine combines:
- Lightweight LLMs like **TinyLlama** and **Mistral (via llama.cpp)**
- Smart utilities for **prediction, planning, and document analysis**
- A clean modular structure that powers both **CLI tools and APIs**
- Zero reliance on external APIs or cloud — **100% local-first**

## 🧠 Philosophy

Drakon AI exists to challenge the norm — to prove that powerful AI engines can be **fully local, transparent, and self-contained**.

It’s an invitation to **build smarter tools without depending on APIs or cloud subscriptions** — with total control in the developer’s hands.
