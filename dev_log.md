## 2025-07-21 23:13:58
- Initialized dev log.
- Reviewed the project structure and current files.
- Inspected `src/drakon_cli.cpp` (contains a stub for Drakon CLI, prints model path and prompt, TODO for model loading and inference).

## 2025-07-30 10:37:00
- Identified critical linker error due to missing `DrakonModel` implementation.
- Confirmed `model_loader.cpp` works and returns dummy weights.
- Created `drakon_model.cpp` with a minimal `DrakonModel` class that:
  - Loads weights using `ModelLoader`
  - Implements a dummy `forward(int token)` method.
- Updated `drakon.h` to declare `DrakonModel` and `DrakonWeights`.
- Reconfirmed `CMakeLists.txt` includes the new source file.
- Build is expected to pass after this fix.

## 2025-08-11 16:55:10
- Fixed compilation errors:
  - Resolved `DrakonWeights` redefinition by removing duplicate from `drakon.h` and including `model_loader.h`
  - Added missing `main.cpp` and `drakon_model.cpp` to main executable in `CMakeLists.txt`
  - Fixed linker errors for both `drakon` and `test_tensor_ops` targets
- Build now completes successfully
- Tested executable with dummy model and prompt - works correctly
- CLI shows proper logging: model loading, tokenization, and inference steps
